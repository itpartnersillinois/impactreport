## Christa Tinari: A Commitment to Peace Education

Online Programs Ed.D. student Christa Tinari was appointed Director of the Contemplative-Based Resilience Project (CBR) at The Garrison Institute, a non-profit organization in New York state. The project provides retreats, courses, and workshops to employees who are exposed to secondary traumatic stress due to their work in social services, health services, or humanitarian aid.

The CBR Project combines research-based practices in mindful awareness and movement, compassion meditation, and education on the neurobiology of stress and resilience. The aim of the project is to help direct service workers to “be well to serve well.”

**“Engaging in compassion practices motivates us to help others but can protect us from the feelings of helplessness and psychological and emotional impacts of secondary stress.”**
