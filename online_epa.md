Christopher Kniesly, current online Ed.D. student in Education Policy, Organization and Leadership, is one of eleven educators nationwide to win a 2022 Presidential Innovation Award for Environmental Educators from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in partnership with the White House Council on Environmental Quality. 

In addition to teaching—and his online Ed.D. work in Diversity and Equity—Kniesly serves as the lead teacher for the Global STEM Challenges Program (GSCP), a three-year, interdisciplinary, after-school academic program focusing on addressing modern challenges and sustainability. GSCP fosters an inclusive, hands-on, after-school curriculum that combines science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and is designed to encourage students to come up with solutions for the National Academy of Engineering’s Grand Challenges for Engineering.
