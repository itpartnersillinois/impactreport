Jerny Walls, an East St. Louis, Illinois native thought she wanted to be a teacher, but a pivotal class ignited her true passion. { .large }

In 2022, Jerny Walls earned her Bachelor’s degree in Learning and Education Studies with concentration in Applied Learning Sciences from the College of Education.“The course EDUC 202 really helped me decide what I want to do within education, which is becoming an educational psychologist. This course taught me more about the educational disparities and debts that are placed in historically looted schools, and how these debts and disparities are impacting the lives of students and teachers.”

During her sophomore year, she worked with assistant professor Nidia Ruedas-Gracia in her lab and learned about the Institutional Review Board (IRB) process, literature reviews, and data coding. Jerny developed a strong in interest for educational psychology.

Jerny is currently enrolled in our Educational Psychology Ph.D. program with a focus on Developmental Sciences here in the College of Education. Her research studies how institutional violence in public schooling impacts Black girls’ sense of belonging to their school as well as their race/ethnicity and gender.
