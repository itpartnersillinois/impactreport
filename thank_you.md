Through the generosity of alumni and friends, we exceeded our campaign goal for the With Illinois campaign receiving $32.88M in gifts. The majority of these funds will create new scholarship and fellowship opportunitiesâ€”lightening the financial load for students who are working to become the next generation of education leaders and scholars. { .text }
