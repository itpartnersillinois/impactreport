## Individual Retirement Account Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) 
At age 72, owners of qualified retirement accounts are required to take an RMD from their retirement funds. Donors can transfer to a qualified charity, such as the College of Education, up to $100,000 annually per spouse.

## Charitable Remainder Unitrust (CRUT) 
A CRUT is a giving vehicle that provides a donor with an income tax deduction as well as provides income to named beneficiary(ies) for their lifetime or a term of years. After the terms of the trust expire, the remainder value can benefit the College of Education.

## Estate Gifts 
These gifts are popular as they ensure you have the resources you need during your lifetime and then afterwards provides a meaningful gift for the benefit of the College of Education. These gifts can be setup through a will, living trust or a beneficiary designation.

## Payroll Deduction 
Many donors choose to give to their charity of choice through a payroll deduction. A charitable payroll deduction allows a donor to “spread” their gift out over the course of several years.

## Pledge 
A pledge is a promise to pay a specified amount over a set period. For example, a donor might pledge $25,000 to create a scholarship in the College of Education to be paid over five years, by installments.
