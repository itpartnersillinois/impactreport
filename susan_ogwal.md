Public policy informs planning, funding, and implementation of solutions to address real-world challenges for Illinois communities and requires motivated leaders whose work ampliﬁes the voices of those most challenged. **Susan Ogwal** has been named the new policy director for the Ofﬁce of Lt. Governor Juliana Stratton following a year of working in Stratton’s ofﬁce as an Illini Science Policy Program (ISPP) Scholar through University of Illinois Extension.

Ogwal will draw from insights, experiences, and community connections formed through the ISPP to continue seeking equitable solutions to beneﬁt the lives of all Illinois residents.

Ogwal holds a Ph.D. in Education Policy, Organization, and Leadership and a master’s degree in Education, both from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign’s College of Education. She has a background in social services, with interests in workforce development, immigration policy, international education, and diversity, equity, and inclusion.

The Illini Science Policy Program pairs advanced degree University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign graduates with host agencies throughout the state to bring the latest advances from campus to address critical issues affecting food, economy, environment, community, and health.

During Ogwal’s 2021 to 2022 ISPP appointment, she accompanied Lt. Governor Stratton on a statewide listening tour of 11 public universities to learn more about diversity in education and the growing teacher shortages throughout Illinois from students, community stakeholders, and educational leaders.

“I am absolutely thrilled with the work of Dr. Susan Ogwal, whose brilliance and hard work made her an invaluable part of my team,” says Lt. Governor Juliana Stratton. “I look forward to continuing to partner with University of Illinois Extension as we collaborate for positive change and provide opportunities for mission-driven public servants.”

Ogwal also helped to launch the Lt. Governor’s Agriculture Equity and Food Insecurity Initiative, which promotes diversity and equity in the agriculture industry and access to nutrient-dense, culturally relevant food for all. She visited communities throughout Illinois to connect with residents, organizations, and state legislators in efforts to advance education, career pathways, and opportunity in the agriculture industry. 

We need to make sure that everybody has food on the table when we talk about the equity work that needs to be done, says Ogwal.

“Agriculture is the number one industry in Illinois, but when we look at the work being done, we see a lot of disparity in emerging farmers, especially with Black people, Indigenous people, and people of color who are in that industry,” says Ogwal. “And we also can’t talk about agriculture without talking about food and making sure it’s accessible to everybody.” { .blockquote }
