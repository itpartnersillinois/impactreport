A graduate seminar in the College of Education is exploring issues of equity, inclusion, and justice through a lens of design—with an eye to reaching those who have historically been marginalized or excluded.

Educational technology is the new kid on the block. And with that newness comes the opportunity to set some things right, says **Mike Tissenbaum**.

“We’re looking at technology in new ways,” says Tissenbaum, who is an assistant professor with appointments in Curriculum and Instruction (C&I) and Educational Psychology (EPSY) in the College of Education. “We’re thinking in a space that is relatively new—ed tech—in the arc of education. If we push for a critical lens from the beginning, we have the opportunity to potentially set new infrastructure.”

## Thinking Through a Lens of Design
“This course gets them thinking about these issues from a real lens of design,” Tissenbaum says. “It’s not just about equity, inclusion, and justice; it’s designing with and for them. It gets them thinking about how what they’re building and making impacts these historical structures, and this needs to be in service to everybody, and especially to those who have been historically marginalized and who have had to fight so hard to even fit within the system, let alone thrive in it, because it’s been designed for those who already thrive.”

During the 14 weeks of the course, Tissenbaum is bringing in eight guest speakers—global leaders in implementing justice and equity design research—to give his students the varying perspectives they need to hear. “The speakers are sharing how they think about justice and equity in their design,” he says. “The students get to hear not just how that weaves through a paper or two but over a career of work. So, it’s an intimate discussion with these people who are doing this kind of work all over the world.”
