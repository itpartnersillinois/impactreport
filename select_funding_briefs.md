Curriculum & Instruction assistant professor Christina (Stina) Krist, PI, and teaching professor Barbara Hug, co-PI, are leading a team of researchers developing A Professional Development Model for High School Teachers to Adapt Curricula Toward Students’ Knowledges and Resources thanks to a four-year, nearly $1M grant from the National Science Foundation. Their project brings together education researchers, high school science teachers, research scientists, and community-based organizations as co-design teams to modify science curriculum materials to be justice- and community-oriented. Building on existing partnerships between education researchers and 11 science teachers in two districts in Illinois, project teams will engage in cycles of curriculum analysis and adaptation over the course of three years.

NSF awarded nearly $700K to Curriculum & Instruction’s Luc Paquette, PI, and H. Chad Lane, Professor of Educational Psychology, Computer Science, and Curriculum & Instruction, and co-PI on Collaborative Research: Advancing the Science of STEM Interest Development through Educational Gameplay with Machine Learning and Data-driven Interviews.

The integration of digital games into STEM education has been an active area of research for quite some time, but details about how students’ interactions with educational games may or may not reflect their interest is more difficult to obtain. This project will use a Minecraft-based simulation environment to advance understanding of how educational digital games can support the development of enduring STEM interest.

![Hedda Meadan-Kaplansky](/img/07/meadan-kaplansky.jpg){ .top-left .fixed-small-width } **Meadan-Kaplansky Receives $2M Institute of Education Sciences Grant**

Hedda Meadan-Kaplansky, professor, Special Education received a $2 million Institute of Education Sciences grant. The study will be conducted with Dr. Sarah Douglas, PI, at Michigan State University. Education at Illinois’ IT Partners will also be involved in this project assisting in developing the digital learning platform. This project aims to develop and test the Family Telepractice AAC Modeling Intervention (FamTAM). Family members are critical communication partners for children who use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). Evidence suggests that children who use AAC experience the best outcomes when family members are well-trained and highly engaged in AAC use.
