Our alumni and donors are committed to shaping the future of education. Thanks to their generosity, the next generation of education leaders can afford a world-class education.{ .large }

We are thrilled to announce that, through the generosity of our alumni and friends, the College of Education has reached our campaign goal for the With Illinois campaign. The fundraising that raised $25 million within the College of Education has focused on making education more affordable for our students. The majority of these funds will create new scholarship and fellowship opportunitiesâ€”lightening the financial load for students who are working to become the next generation of education leaders and scholars.

While we are proud to reach this critically important milestone, our fundraising efforts will not stop. We remain resolute in our commitment to secure private resources from now to the conclusion of the campaign timeline in 2022.

The Office of Advancement will continue to work with our alumni and donors to make Illinois accessible to all who are looking to make Illinois their alma mater.
