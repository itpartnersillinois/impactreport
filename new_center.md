**The Illinois Center for Transition and Work (ICTW)** provides resources and training for special educators and others who are preparing high school students with significant disabilities to work after graduation. It’s not always easy to find a job after graduating high school. For those with significant disabilities, the road to work is more challenging.

That’s where the Illinois Center for Transition and Work comes in.

“Our goal is to provide resources to help teachers understand effective ways of working with students with disabilities, to help them prepare for jobs,” says Stacy Dymond, a professor in Special Education at the College of Education and one of the center’s directors. “We focus on students with the most significant disabilities those who need extra support in order to successfully obtain employment.”

## Helping Students Transition to Meaningful Employment

The Illinois Center for Transition and Work (ICTW), a statewide training and technical assistance center, is funded through an Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) grant. The center began working with schools in the fall of 2021, offering a variety of resources on their website, including case studies, fact sheets, research briefs, and webinars, as well as other information useful to those who work with students with disabilities.

All of this is geared toward getting meaningful jobs for high school graduates who have disabilities and who are not pursuing further education. Through ICTW resources and offerings, teachers will be better equipped to help those students prepare for work after graduation.

## Joint Venture

ICTW is a joint venture between the College of Education and the College of Applied Health Sciences. David Strauser, a professor in Kinesiology and Community Health whose work is focused on the career development process and labor market participation of young adults, is co-director with Dymond. 

“We wanted to bring the disciplines of special education and rehabilitation together, rehabilitation being the adult service agency, so that there was greater coordination between those disciplines and we could get more individuals with disabilities employed in the future,” Dymond says.

Collaboration is also taking place at the state level. “We have a transition leadership group that includes ISBE and the Department of Rehabilitative Services,” Dymond says. 

Discussions are taking place among the group to determine how to most effectively work together at the state level to facilitate how students with
disabilities in high schools across the state can transition to work.

As for the types of jobs that they can transition into, that’s wide open, Dymond says. “A student with a disability can do anything in the community. They might need individualized supports, and they might need a job carved out for them, something unique to support their strengths, but those are the skills we give to educators to help make that happen.”
