**How can sustainability education advance equity and justice in research and public education?**

Over the summer and fall, the **Sustainability Education Collective Conference Series** was launched by **Samantha Lindgren**, assistant professor in Education Policy, Organization & Leadership; **Jon Hale**, associate professor in Education Policy, Organization & Leadership and Curriculum & Instruction; and Luis Rodriguez, associate director for education and outreach for the Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment and associate professor in Illinois’ Grainger College of Engineering.

## Climate Change and Institutional Racism

Environmental and sustainability education is expanding to not only look at the mechanisms of climate change but how the impacts of that change are not evenly distributed.

## Advancing Equity through Sustainability Education

The conference series engaged a diverse community of sustainability education researchers, educators, nongovernmental organization experts, and learners in identifying solutions to the current crises across multiple scales and methodologies.

Participants took part in discussions on topics such as using geographic information systems to incorporate maps into curricula from K-college and how colleges of education can become more focused on, and a part of, climate change solutions.

Others involved in the conference series from the College of Education include Asif Wilson, assistant professor in Curriculum & Instruction; Jennifer Johnson, a post-doctoral student; and Nicole DelMastro-Jeffery, a doctoral student.
