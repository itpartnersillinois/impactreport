## Emily Stone has been named the College of Education’s inaugural Director of Public Engagement

![Emily Stone, Director of Public Engagement](/img/emily-stone.png){ .top-left } Emily Stone has hit the ground running as she heads the  College’s efforts in engaging with faculty across campus and with community collaborators. The College of Education, says Emily Stone, has always been a leader in public engagement, both on campus and beyond. “Previously, though, there hasn’t been a central point person to support areas that have growth potential and to guide this work and connect collaborators who don’t necessarily know about each other and who could help each other elevate and expand their work,” says Stone.  Now, campus and community collaborators have that central point person in Stone, who was named the College’s first director of public engagement. “Dean James Anderson has a lot of passion in this area, as do I,” says Stone, who has a Master’s in Public Health. “We want to help the College have a visible and significant societal impact. There’s so much potential when you combine academic collaborators with their expertise and passion with the boots-on-the-ground people, the community collaborators who have the pulse of the community and understand the issues. When you can get those teams to work together, there’s this huge potential for impact and that’s why this area is so exciting. 

**"This position will support faculty and staff working in community engaged  research and public engagement, as well as provide undergraduate and graduate  students with opportunities to connect their studies to real-world problems."** {.blockquote .clear}
