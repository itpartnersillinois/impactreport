        <h1>Alumnus Makes Surgical Training Model a Reality in Africa</h1>
        <p class="byline">Tom Hanlon</p>
        <p><img src="/archive2022/img/surgical_training.png" alt="Surgical training program" class="left"></p>
<p><strong>Anthony Dwyer,</strong> Ph.D. ‘22 EPOL, is part of a team that has created training modules to virtually train surgeons in carrying out reconstructive surgery on patients in limited-resource environments. Dwyer’s work has been directly influenced by what he learned through the <strong>College of Education’s online Learning Design and Leadership program</strong>.</p>
<p>Sub-Saharan Africa is the world’s hotbed for reconstructive surgeries. People in this region annually require more than 16 million reconstructive surgeries to treat wounds and defects caused by burns, trauma, cancer, and congenital conditions. These conditions lead to disability, joblessness, pain, stigma, social isolation, mental health issues, and educational barriers.</p>
<p>Yet, Rwanda, for example—a sub-Saharan African country of 13.6 million people—has two plastic surgeons.</p>
<p><strong>AmoSmile</strong> — an Operation Smile and AmoDisc collaboration—is doing something about that.</p>
<p>Anthony Dwyer, vice president of medical technology and innovation for Operation Smile, is part of the AmoSmile team, which has representatives from 10 countries across the globe. Dwyer earned his PhD in Learning Design and Leadership from the College of Education in May 2022, and his experience in the program has helped AmoSmile become one of four finalists for a $1M grant offered through the Global Surgical Training Challenge. Initially, 75 teams entered the Challenge, funded by the Intuitive Foundation.</p>
<h2>Helping Surgeons—and Patients—in Resource-limited Countries</h2>
<p>“Hospitals are overwhelmed,” Dwyer says. “So, the question is how do you train the next group of clinicians in the area with limited funding? Here at the University of Illinois, it’s wonderful, because I have a 64,000-square-foot simulation center [the Jump Simulation Center], 3D printers, and computer-aided design software. They don’t have that in Rwanda.”</p>
<p>The answer: design a low-cost simulator, build a curriculum, and create a training application that can be accessed through cellphones to provide clinicians the knowledge and experience they need.</p>
<p><img src="/archive2022/img/amosmile.png" alt="AmoSmile group in Rwanda" class="right"></p>
<p>In doing just that, AmoSmile has created a surgical training model that incorporates virtual learning modules and simulations to teach surgeons how to restore form, function, and feeling through local flap surgery called Z-plasty. The procedure calls on the surgeon to cut a Z-shaped flap where the burnt skin has fused together, to open up scar tissue and provide greater range of motion and mobility.</p>
<p>“We had to design a locally-sourced, low-cost simulator using everyday items available to people in Rwanda,” Dwyer says. “They have wood, they have nails, they have string or twine, they have tissue-like substance. We take a toilet paper roll and bend it to give it a little curvature and we can spindle it up to get the surface tension to be just like skin. And we can do all that for less than $5.”</p>
<p>That’s the physical side of the simulator, a tool to learn with. The tool to learn from comes from the app.</p>
<h2>A Training App for Reconstructive Surgeries</h2>
<p>The app provides step-by-step modules designed to facilitate self-directed learning and training for local flap surgery. “It provides the clinical knowledge, the foundational knowledge of pharmacology, anatomy, and physiology, to be able to safely care for a patient,” Dwyer says. When trainees have proven their mastery of the information through a test bank, they use the app to show that they know how to conduct the procedure. “We can walk through an entire surgical case or clinical procedure without touching a patient,” Dwyer says. “Attending surgeons give them feedback on their hand control, tissue control, suture length or spacing, the amount of depth they took with their scalpel, and a million other things.”</p>
<p>Besides equipping doctors with the knowledge and expertise to perform Z-plasties, the training modules and app greatly cut down on attending surgeons’ time. Many times, an attending surgeon will spend 10 days in a foreign country, with eight of them focused on providing the foundational knowledge and technical skills, Dwyer says. “Now, we can jump almost right to the end. Now, it’s show me that you can do these things, and I’ll give you real-time feedback.”</p>
