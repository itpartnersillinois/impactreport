        "quote": "My work focuses on educators’ professional learning in K-12 mathematics, science, and STEM contexts. I use a learning sciences perspective to investigate the reasoning, sensemaking, and processes used by educators as they transform and reimagine their practice. This involves using a variety of research methodologies, including qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods, and relies heavily on video data from classrooms and professional learning experiences."

        "quote": "My scholarship is centered in the examination of how Black youth engage in the reading and writing of speculative fiction to discuss and challenge their experiences with social injustice; the consideration of how intersecting oppressions infiltrate the field of education and how educators must use their imaginations to dream of ways to challenge injustice in schools; and the demonstration of how Black people use speculative storytelling to metaphorically describe modern and historical antiblackness and to dream of worlds and futures in which Black people are free from the burdens of societal injustice."
