Illinois Early Childhood Asset Map (IECAM) helps state agencies understand the risks the state faces in early childhood well-being, and where those risks are not being adequately addressed. And that’s good news for the children of the state of Illinois. { .large }

IECAM—Illinois Early Childhood Asset Map—was created to provide early childhood data that state agencies and policymakers can translate into information to gain the insight they need to facilitate the appropriate allocation of resources and improve outcomes for children in Illinois.

Created in 2006 and housed at the University of Illinois Urbana- Champaign, IECAM has been a twoperson operation for most of its existence, but in recent years has added staff to increase its output and effectiveness. Currently, IECAM is partnering with the Erikson Institute, a graduate school in child development, and Voices for Illinois Children, an advocacy group, to develop a new edition of the Illinois Risk and Reach Report. The report is a set of data tools that includes an interactive website of child well-being indicators in relation to family stability, health, and early care and education.

“We know there’s a lot of risk out there,” says Dawn Thomas, IECAM director and co-principal investigator. “And we know there’s a lot of reach, in terms of early childhood programs. What we don’t know is how they interact together.”

The initiative was conceptualized in response to priorities identified during the university’s “The Next 150” strategic planning process— specifically, that public engagement become a formalized part of the Illinois student experience. The program’s goal is to develop Illinois students to be future leaders who grasp the unique commitments, traditions, and challenges of distinct communities by facilitating service learning and volunteering opportunities with campus and offcampus organizations.

The data comes from a variety of sources, Thomas says: the Illinois Department of Public Health, the Illinois Department of Human Services, the US Census Bureau, the Illinois State Board of Education, and more. “Really anywhere that holds data, we will try to get,” she says. The risk and reach report combines the data in composite indices and mapping, Thomas notes, to show, county by county, the reach vs. the risk.

“What makes our report different from other states’ risk and reach reports is we are not only looking at the risks and the reaches provided, but also at what the state is saying they are providing in fiscal monies,” { .blockquote }

<h2>IECAM is a National Leader in Early Childhood Data</h2>

“IECAM has the infrastructure and the expertise that Erikson is looking for with this project,” says Catherine Corr, co-principal investigator and assistant professor in Special Education at the College of Education. “Our infrastructure positions us in a way that no other state is, in terms of early childhood data. We’ve been able to set the stage for other states to think about why collecting data on a statewide basis is really important, particularly around early childhood.”

As for the state of Illinois, IECAM gives policymakers and other stakeholders in Chicago a greater understanding of what the situation is downstate, Corr adds. “We’ve been able to bring visibility to the whole state,” she says.
