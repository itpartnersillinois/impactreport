Illinois Early Childhood Asset Map (IECAM) helps state agencies understand the risks the state faces in early childhood well-being, and where those risks are not being adequately addressed. And that’s good news for the children of the state of Illinois. { .large }

IECAM—Illinois Early Childhood Asset Map—was created to provide early childhood data that state agencies and policymakers can translate into information to gain the insight they need to facilitate the appropriate allocation of resources and improve outcomes for children in Illinois.

Created in 2006 and housed at the University of Illinois Urbana- Champaign, IECAM has been a twoperson operation for most of its existence, but in recent years has added staff to increase its output and effectiveness. Currently, IECAM is partnering with the Erikson Institute, a graduate school in child development, and Voices for Illinois Children, an advocacy group, to develop a new edition of the Illinois Risk and Reach Report. The report is a set of data tools that includes an interactive website of child well-being indicators in relation to family stability, health, and early care and education.

“We know there’s a lot of risk out there,” says Dawn Thomas, IECAM director and co-principal investigator. “And we know there’s a lot of reach, in terms of early childhood programs. What we don’t know is how they interact together.”

The initiative was conceptualized in response to priorities identified during the university’s “The Next 150” strategic planning process— specifically, that public engagement become a formalized part of the Illinois student experience. The program’s goal is to develop Illinois students to be future leaders who grasp the unique commitments, traditions, and challenges of distinct communities by facilitating service learning and volunteering opportunities with campus and offcampus organizations.

The data comes from a variety of sources, Thomas says: the Illinois Department of Public Health, the Illinois Department of Human Services, the US Census Bureau, the Illinois State Board of Education, and more. “Really anywhere that holds data, we will try to get,” she says. The risk and reach report combines the data in composite indices and mapping, Thomas notes, to show, county by county, the reach vs. the risk.

“What makes our report different from other states’ risk and reach reports is we are not only looking at the risks and the reaches provided, but also at what the state is saying they are providing in fiscal monies,” { .blockquote }

<h2>IECAM is a National Leader in Early Childhood Data</h2>

“IECAM has the infrastructure and the expertise that Erikson is looking for with this project,” says Catherine Corr, co-principal investigator and assistant professor in Special Education at the College of Education. “Our infrastructure positions us in a way that no other state is, in terms of early childhood data. We’ve been able to set the stage for other states to think about why collecting data on a statewide basis is really important, particularly around early childhood.”

As for the state of Illinois, IECAM gives policymakers and other stakeholders in Chicago a greater understanding of what the situation is downstate, Corr adds. “We’ve been able to bring visibility to the whole state,” she says.

<h2>Community engagement is more important than ever, as organizations across our community are facing unprecedented challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.</h2>

The We CU 10-week summer scholars program empowered students to respond to these challenges. Scholars were matched with community-based projects that could be completed remotely. Participating students could also apply for mini grants to offset costs associated with service activities. Students who completed at least 40  hours of service during the 10-week summer program were recognized with a We CU honor ceremony and certificate of completion. { .large }

## Pilot Program Focused on Pandemic 

The onset of the pandemic created urgent needs for community organizations, as well as a heightened desire for connection and purpose for many students—accelerating the We CU program’s launch timeline and participation numbers.

On June 1, 2020, We CU officially launched a 10-week summer pilot program to address local community needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some 232 students representing 12 colleges from across the Urbana-Champaign campus became the inaugural cohort of We CU Community Engaged Scholars. Using GivePulse, an online platform that lists volunteer opportunities and tracks service hours, We CU students were matched with one or more of the nearly 50 volunteer projects—all of which  could be completed 100% remotely—submitted by 34 local organizations. Scholars received online training and were able to apply for “mini-grants” to offset costs associated with service activities. 

We CU students logged a combined 4,504 hours of community outreach during the pilot.

COVID-19 related service projects included developing contact tracing methods, sewing re-usable face masks, helping organizations move their in-person activities to virtual platforms, and more.

“We saw an opportunity to create community for students as they work together on these projects, and to provide support for organizations who needed rapid help moving things online that were never online before,” says Stone.

Students who completed at least 40 hours of service during the 10-week pilot program were recognized during the virtual We CU Scholar Recognition Ceremony on August 13. 

## Future Directions

Consistent evaluation and revision of the program is essential to its future success, says Christopher Napolitano, Educational Psychology faculty member and part of a research team assessing We CU. With the success of the 10-week pilot program, there is plenty of participation data to measure impact and help shape an improved future experience. Madison Sewell, doctoral student in EPSY’s Developmental Sciences and part of the research team, is currently analyzing data from the pilot program to provide insights for publications and program adjustments.

Additionally, Stone, along with the Chancellor’s Office, is working to leverage the summer pilot program’s success to secure additional funding to support a full four-year We CU Community Engaged Scholars framework for all incoming students. The full program will honor students at  graduation who have completed 300-400 hours of service during their academic career.

Stone says the group plans to continue to host service challenges, similar to the 10-week focus on COVID-19 projects, providing more chances for students to make a difference in the community.

“We’ve heard from our students how deeply impacted they are by the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and others, and by our country’s  broader systemic racism,” says Stone. “We are looking to develop more opportunities for students to support causes connected to social and racial justice.”
