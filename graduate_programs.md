<h2>Learning Language and Culture Through Games</h3>
<p>Two Ph.D. students from the College of Education are developing an application to teach children how to read Farsi. “TooTak,” a mobile application featuring a talking parrot helps children ages 6-10 learn how to read Farsi. “TooTak” in one of the Iranian languages means “talking parrot,”</p>

<p><strong>Shafagh Hadinezhad</strong>, a Ph.D. student in Curriculum & Instruction, is a co-founder of TooTak. <strong>Sourabh Garg</strong> a Ph.D. student in Curriculum & Instruction, is designing games for TooTak. Their project is part of the current cohort of <strong>iVenture Accelerator</strong> projects, the educational accelerator for student startups at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.</p>
