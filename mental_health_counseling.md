When the Illinois Board of Education gave the College of Education the green light in March 2021 to move forward with a **Master’s of Science in Mental Health Counseling** program, the College was ready to go. 

“The American Psychological Association had been talking for many years about accrediting programs at the master’s level within the realm of psychological sciences,” says **Lisa Kinderman**, clinical assistant professor in the Counseling Psychology Division of the Department of Educational Psychology. “We wanted to be poised to influence or be part of this new emerging identity within the profession, and we also saw an opportunity to create a program that is different than many of the other programs that are offered in the state.”
