Alumna Archaa Shrivastav has been a champion of social justice both in the classroom and in the world of children’s literature. { .large }

Archaa Shrivastav earned a bachelor’s degree in Elementary Education in 2011 and a master’s degree in Curriculum and Instruction with a focus on language and literacy in 2012. This led her to earning a prestigious award in children’s literature: the 2021 Stonewall Book Award—Mike Morgan and Larry Romans Children’s and Young Adult Literature Award, presented by the American Library Association (ALA).

The award is given annually to English-language works of exceptional merit for children or teens relating to the gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender experience.

Shrivastav’s book **We Are Little Feminists: Families** is aimed at children from birth through age four. It’s a board book, filled with full-page photos of various types of joyful families, with rhyming text written by Shrivastav.
