## Ed.D., Global Studies 

"The Global Studies curriculum was unique to anything I’d seen before, notably in how interdisciplinary it was. The opportunity to study everything from international development to global educational policy to human rights education was enticing. One of my primary goals was to have an online, doctoral degree experience that was dynamic and engaging, not one that just felt like correspondence coursework. The College’s commitment to synchronous weekly class meetings, on-campus conferences, as well as virtual events that include online students have made me feel part of an academic community." {.blockquote-small}
