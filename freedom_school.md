**The Illinois State Board of Education announced a $17M grant to create the nation’s first state-funded Freedom Schools network. The Phillip Jackson Freedom Schools Grant is being used to create summer and after-school programs aimed at addressing opportunity gaps and improving outcomes for low-income students. The College of Education’s Jon Hale has been instrumental in advocating for Freedom Schools, getting a Freedom School started in Champaign, and developing Illinois’ Freedom Schools network.**

**Jon Hale**, associate professor in the department of Education Policy, Organization & Leadership and Curriculum & Instruction, has been integral to the success of the Illinois Freedom Schools network and shared his thoughts about the importance of the legislation and funding:

“This is historic legislation,” says Hale. “It’s the first time a state legislature has appropriated money for Freedom School programs. I’m involved in discussions with New Jersey legislators, with California legislators, with some Ohio representatives who are interested. We’re trying to get everyone in the same room.”

He has shared the language of the Illinois grant, which he and others at the University of llinois helped revise, so others can see what legislation looks like that has been passed.

“The Children’s Defense Fund (CDF) national office sees the University of Illinois as a partner in this,” Hale says. “They see us as one of the few universities across the country that are interested in Freedom Schools. So, that’s been great for Illinois to be at the forefront of this solution.”

Our local Freedom Schools are a huge success. “In Champaign, we’ve gone from 30 students our first year, to 50 our second, to 150 this year,” Hale says.

**Tracy Dace**, executive director of the Ujima Freedom School and founder and CEO of DREAAM (Driven to Reach Excellence & Academic Achievement for Males) says the Freedom School experience was ambitious, powerful, and incredible.

Dace has been excited to have DREAAM co-lead the planning and implementation of the Freedom School initiative in Champaign with the University of Illinois and Champaign Unit 4 School District.

“Our collaborative partnership is vital to the sustainability of this critical opportunity for Black children and families,” he says. “This year, state funding was instrumental in expanding Freedom School to reach more children. However, we need the support of the community and donors to ensure that Freedom School is here to stay and grow. Our children are watching to see what we will do. We can’t disappoint them.”
