**Douglas and Dorothy Dirks** are long-time donors to the College of Education at Illinois, having established a merit-based scholarship for undergraduate students in the College.

But Doug, Ed.D. ’80 ED, and Dorothy, B.S. ’83 C&I, Ed.M. ’91 and Ed.D. ’03 EPOL, haven’t stopped there. Just as they overachieved as Education students themselves, they are also now giving toward a program they’ve become passionate about: **Champaign Freedom School.**

“Dorothy and I have made a study of the American Civil Rights Movement and have visited many of the places in the South that were the sites of significant events in that period,” says Doug. “We visited the former Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, where Septima Clark taught adults how to teach literacy and citizenship, and we learned that Clark’s methods are being used today in the current versions of Freedom Schools! Sometimes teachers’ accomplishments have long-lasting effects.”

While the couple is now retired from their careers as educators, the Dirks continue to be students of the history of education and interested in making an impact on the educational systems of today.

The Dirks felt led to give to the Champaign Freedom School, a program of the College of Education and community partners. Their gift supported the cost of training one teacher and provided one student scholarship to attend the 2022 summer program.
