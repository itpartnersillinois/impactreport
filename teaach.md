The State of Illinois made history last year when it became the first in the nation to mandate the teaching of Asian American history in K-12 public schools. To support the implementation of the **TEAACH (Teaching Equitable Asian American Community History) Act (HB 0736)**, the College of Education at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is leveraging its faculty members’ expertise and extensive knowledge of this subject matter to launch a first-of-its-kind professional development series as a go-to resource for Illinois teachers and librarians in learning and teaching about Asian American history.

**Yoon Pak**, professor and head in the Department of Education Policy, Organization & Leadership (EPOL), was part of an Illinois State Board of Education task force to develop resources for elementary through high school educators to teach students about Asian American history, with a special focus on their contributions and influence in Illinois and the Midwest.

The TEAACH Illinois online professional development series is asynchronous, self-paced, and includes three modules that each address specific aspects of Asian American experiences. The series’ approach considers the racialized experiences of minority groups in the U.S.,particularly the historical and structural inequities and problematic stereotypes of Asian Americans as “model minorities” and “forever foreigners”.

The series is designed to not just provide lesson plan content and resources but to also cultivate educators’ insights and reflections on their own identities,unconscious biases, and approaches to teaching Asian American history. Teachers can access the TEAACH Illinois training free of charge and earn professional development hours upon module completion.

Additionally, University of Illinois researchers will collect data from participants’ completed course assignments to better understand teacher and librarian experiences and identities in teaching Asian American history. All data and feedback gathered through the study will be anonymized and used to improve future iterations of the training modules.
