**The National Science Foundation awarded $20 million dollars over five years to establish the Inclusive and Intelligent Technologies for Education (INVITE) Institute, based in the College of Education.**

![H Chad Lane](/img/15/lane.jpg){ .top-left .fixed-small-width } INVITE research broadens engagement and learning of STEM among historically marginalized Pre-K through 12th grade students. More than 96,000 youths across 24 school districts will be engaged in enhanced STEM learning using INVITE platforms designed to promote persistence, academic resilience and collaboration, qualities that research has shown are critical to academic achievement. Schools, universities, community organizations, and museums will provide formal and informal learning opportunities – emphasizing hands-on activities related to real-world challenges.

The NSF’s support enables us to pursue transformative interdisciplinary research in AI, the learning sciences and psychology, and to couple that with aggressive outreach and AI education efforts so we can reach students and teachers at a national scale.
