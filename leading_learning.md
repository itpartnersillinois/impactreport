**Asif Wilson**, assistant professor in Curriculum and Instruction, is leading the development, implementation, and evaluation of training in inclusive, inquiry-based instruction for K-12 social studies teachers throughout the state of Illinois.

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker signed **House Bill 2170** a little over a year ago, the creation of an **Inclusive American History Commission (IAHC)** was part of the omnibus legislation.

Over 118 teachers from across the state registered for the June 2022 professional learning launch —- called **I3: Inclusive, Inquiry-Based Social Studies for Illinois**. This first cohort in the “pilot year” completed a five-part series on self-interrogating their own dispositions, inquiry-based learning, and inclusive American history.

Continuation of the professional learning with ISBE will include spots for 250 teachers this coming academic year (2022-23). Then, a scaled-up version will be available to every social studies teacher in the state, in a variety of K-12 educational settings, for the 2023-24 school year.
