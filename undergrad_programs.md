<h2>Anisa Chatman | Creating Positive Change</h3>
<p>Chatman is a junior in our Learning & Education Studies program. She knew she wanted to enter the field of education after presenting a research essay in high school about classroom segregation. She enjoys attending the many different cultural events on campus such as the Black and Latinx Summit and the various events hosted by the Bruce D. Nesbitt African American Cultural Center and the Central Black Student Union. She recently studied abroad in Nairobi, Kenya.</p>

<p><strong>“This life-changing experience has encouraged me to learn multiple languages, understand my position as an American, and makes me eager to learn about different cultures. I believe as an educator, all of these things can be very beneficial to creating a more inclusive and welcoming space for all different kinds of students.”</strong></p>
